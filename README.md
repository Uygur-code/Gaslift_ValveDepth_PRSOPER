# Gaslift valve depth calculations using Petex IPM Prosper software
  This is a startup for more comprehensive coding and it is useful for conceptual modeling of gas lift design in an oil well.
  Following the steps that it is used for conceptual modeling:-
   1. Prosper_Gas_lift.py do the calculations.
   2. GasLiftPanel is the visualization for the gaslift valve depth results using Holoviz.org Panel as webapp and utilizing Plotly for visualization.
